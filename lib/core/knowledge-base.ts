    content: "For muscle growth, weekly volume is a key driver. Schoenfeld et al. (2017) found a dose-response relationship, with 10-20+ sets per muscle group per week being optimal for most individuals. Beginners should start closer to 10, while advanced lifters may need over 20.",

    topic: "Progressive Overload",
    content: "To continue making progress, you must progressively increase the demands on your muscles. This can be done by adding more weight, performing more reps, or increasing the number of sets over time. A 3-week accumulation phase followed by a 1-week deload is a common and effective strategy.",

    topic: "Training Frequency",
    content: "Training a muscle group 2-3 times per week appears to be superior to once per week for hypertrophy (Schoenfeld et al., 2016). Higher frequencies allow for better volume distribution and quality of work per session.",

    topic: "Intensity of Effort",
    content: "Training close to muscular failure is crucial for stimulating growth. This is often measured in Reps in Reserve (RIR), where an RIR of 1-3 is a potent stimulus. This corresponds to an RPE of 7-9.",
