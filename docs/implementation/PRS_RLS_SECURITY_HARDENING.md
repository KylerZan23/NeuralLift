# Implementation Plan: PRS Table RLS Security Hardening

**Task 1.2: Harden Row Level Security (RLS) for the prs Table**

**Goal:** Eliminate the permissive `using (true)` read policy on the prs table and enforce strict, ownership-based access at the database layer.

## Problem Identified

The initial schema (`0001_schema.sql`) contained a security vulnerability in the `prs` table RLS policy:

```sql
create policy if not exists prs_read on public.prs for select using (true);
```

This policy allows any authenticated user to read any user's PR data, which violates data privacy and security principles.

## Solution Implemented

**Migration File:** `0008_prs_secure_rls.sql`

### Changes Made:

1. **Dropped Permissive Read Policy:**
   - Removed the `prs_read` policy that used `using (true)`

2. **Created Secure Read Policy:**
   ```sql
   create policy prs_read_secure on public.prs
     for select
     using (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

3. **Updated Write Policies:**
   - Enhanced insert policy to check ownership: `auth.uid() = user_id`
   - Enhanced update policy with both `using` and `with check` clauses for ownership

4. **Ensured RLS Enabled:**
   - Explicitly confirmed RLS is enabled on the table

## Security Benefits

- ✅ **Data Isolation:** Users can only access their own PR data
- ✅ **Write Protection:** Users can only create/update their own PR records  
- ✅ **Defense in Depth:** Database-level security enforcement
- ✅ **Consistent Pattern:** Matches the secure RLS pattern used in `pr_history` table

## Testing Requirements

1. **Functional Testing:** Verify authenticated users can still access their own PR data
2. **Security Testing:** Confirm users cannot access other users' PR data
3. **API Endpoint Testing:** Ensure `/app/api/pr/...` endpoints continue to work correctly

## Migration Deployment

This migration should be applied to:
- [ ] Development environment
- [ ] Staging environment  
- [ ] Production environment

**Note:** This is a security-critical change that restricts data access. Thorough testing is required before production deployment.
